Cause she* gets up in the morning,

And she* goes to work at nine,

And she* comes back home at five-thirty,

Gets the same train every time.

Cause her* world is built round punctuality,

It never fails.


And she's oh, so good,

And she's oh, so fine,

And she's oh, so healthy,

In her* body and her* mind.

She*'s a well respected man about town,

Doing the best things so <strike>conservatively</strike> awesome.


And her mother* goes to meetings,

While her mother* is no maid,

And she stirs the tea with councilors,

While discussing foreign trade,

And she passes looks, as well as bills

At every suave young man*


Cause she*'s oh, so good,

And she*'s oh, so fine,

And she*'s oh, so healthy,

In her* body and her* mind.

she*'s a well respected femme about town,

Doing the best things so <strike>conservatively</strike> awesome.
